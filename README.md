# REACT REDUX NODEJS MONGODB MUSICPLAYER APP


Musicplayer with songs list.
The app identifies songs in src/static folder:
It gets a fingerprint using chrompraint (fpcalc), the fingerprint is sent to accoustid webservice 
and receives basic metadata. Then, it consumes musixmatch webservice for additional metadata.
The last webservice retrieves cover photo from google api (limit up to 100 HTTP requests per day).

Metadata is sent to monogdb and presented at client.
